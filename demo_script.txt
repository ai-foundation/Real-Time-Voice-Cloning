once upon a time there was a kingdom with no king
who makes the laws a boy asked his mother she was getting ready to take eggs to market
we make our own his mother said and are better off for it then they headed to the market
suddenly a man ripped the egg basket away you cant the boy cried and he threw a fist
the man pushed the child away and said who made you king
